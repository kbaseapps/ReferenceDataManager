# ReferenceDataManager (RDM)
This module is built to periodically check and load reference data into KBase. Currently, RDM can handle genomes and taxons.

### Genomes:
1. RefSeq genomes are loaded into _RefseqGenomesWS_
2. ~~Ensembl genomes are loaded into~~
3. Phytozome genomes are loaded into _Phytozome_Genomes_

### Taxons:
NCBI Taxons are loaded into _ReferenceTaxons_
